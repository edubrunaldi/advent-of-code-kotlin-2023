# Advent of Code 2023 - Kotlin Solutions

## Introduction
Welcome to my repository of solutions for the Advent of Code 2023  created by [edubrunaldi][github] using the [Advent of Code Kotlin Template][template] delivered by JetBrains. 

In this project, I'm tackling each challenge using Kotlin. My aim is to explore and showcase the capabilities of Kotlin, a language I'm passionate about.

## Goals
- **Kotlin Proficiency**: To solve all challenges using Kotlin, demonstrating my proficiency and understanding of the language.
- **Advanced Features**: To leverage Kotlin's advanced features, such as extension functions and collection operations, to provide elegant and efficient solutions.
- **Code Readability**: To ensure that all solutions are written with the utmost attention to readability and maintainability, mirroring the standards I uphold in a professional environment.

    [Advent of Code][aoc] â€“ An annual event of Christmas-oriented programming challenges started December 2015.
    Every year since then, beginning on the first day of December, a programming puzzle is published every day for twenty-five days.
